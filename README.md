## Overview ##
This project is a collection of helper scripts for Ubiquiti UniFi hardware and software.  Currently it contains a single script.

## unifi-cloudflared-dns-over-https.sh
This script will provide an apt-managed install of cloudflared on Ubiquiti Gateway devices running UniFi OS, such as the UXG Lite.  It configures a DNS forwarder that listens on 127.0.0.53:53 that sends requests to a Cloudflare DNS over HTTPS endpoint.  If you use Cloudflare Gateway (part of Cloudflare Zero Trust), you can specify its DNS over HTTPS URL, otherwise it will use the URL associated with their 1.1.1.1 DNS service.

### Usage ###

1. Enable UniFi SSH Access
    In the UniFi Controller web interface, go to the page under _Settings &rarr; System &rarr; Advanced_ and scroll down to _Device Authentication_.  Device Authentication should be checked and authentication options configured to enable SSH access to your UniFi devices.

    ![Screenshot of Device Authentication portion of UniFi Controller configuration](images/unifi-ssh-config.png)

1. #### Copy script to gateway ####
    In this directory, copy the script to the UniFi device.  Substitute your SSH username and gateway IP in this command as needed.
    ```
    scp unifi-cloudflared-dns-over-https.sh exampleusername@192.168.0.1:/root/.
    ```

1. #### Running the script ####
    SSH to the gateway.  Substitute your SSH username and gateway IP in this command as needed.
    ```
    ssh exampleusername@192.168.0.1
    ```
    You should see a MOTD with an ASCII art UniFi logo.

    ***WARNING!***  **You are the root user once you log in.**  To quote [Ubiquiti's documentation:](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/204909374-UniFi-Connect-with-SSH-Advanced)
    > Inexperienced users risk making changes that may degrade network performance, or even worse, completely break your deployment. Proceed with caution.

    [Optional] If you have a Cloudflare Gateway DNS over HTTPS URL, you can specify that now (xxxxxxxxxx will be a string of alphanumeric characters)
    ```
    export CLOUDFLARE_DNS_OVER_HTTPS_URL=https://xxxxxxxxxx.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query
    ```

    Mark the script executable:
    ```
    chmod +x unifi-cloudflared-dns-over-https.sh
    ```

    Now, run the script:
    ```
    ./unifi-cloudflared-dns-over-https.sh
    ```
    Output:
    ```

    Install of cloudflared successful! üéâ

    To finish configuration, do the following steps

    1. Reload systemctl to pick up the new unit file
        systemctl daemon-reload

    2. Start service now and run after system restart
        systemctl enable --now cloudflare-dns-proxy.service
    ```

    Assuming everything was successful, follow the instructions to enable and start the cloudflared service.

1. #### Post-Install Verification ####
    Check that the new service is running:
    ```
    systemctl status cloudflare-dns-proxy
    ```
    You should see a result similar to this:
    ```

    <br>
    At the prompt, run a `dig` using the new DNS forwarder:

    ```
    dig @127.0.0.53 ui.com
    ```

    The result should look something like this: 

    ```

    If you get any errors here, don't move on to the next section until you've addressed them.

1. #### Configuring WAN DNS Server
    Once the above is complete, you need to tell the gateway to use the forwarder rather than its default DNS server.  Go to _Settings &rarr; Internet_ and select your WAN.  It is named _Primary (WAN 1)_ by default, but may have a different name.  Enable Manual configuration and uncheck _Auto_ next to _DNS Server_.  Then put the forwarder's address of 127.0.0.53 in the text field next to _Primary Server_.  Click the _Apply Changes_ button and you're done.

1. #### Verifying DoH is working on your network
    Go to [Cloudflare's DNS test page](https://1.1.1.1/help) in a browser that is not using DNS over HTTPS.  (You may need to disable it in your browser - it's on by default in Firefox.)  If everything is working you will see _Yes_ next to _Using DNS over HTTPS (DoH)_.

1. #### [Optional] Locking down other DNS requests ####
    Some devices have hardcoded DNS server values that may be used for tracking or other purposes.  To prevent devices from using alternative DNS you'll need create firewall rules blocking to [as described here](https://ben.balter.com/2020/12/04/over-engineered-home-network-for-privacy-and-security/#blocking-all-other-dns-lookups) but the specifics are outside the scope of this README.

### TODO ###
- Add ability to have multiple DoH forwarders
- Add command line flags to handle only running part of the setup

### Acknowledgements ###
- Configuration and service management is inspired by [this post](https://eldridgea.substack.com/p/encrypted-cloudflare-dns-on-unifi)
- Repo install is based on the [instructions](https://pkg.cloudflare.com/index.html#debian-bullseye) on Cloudflare's website 
- Great post about UniFi network config [here](https://ben.balter.com/2020/12/04/over-engineered-home-network-for-privacy-and-security/#blocking-all-other-dns-lookups) and [its followup](https://ben.balter.com/2021/09/01/how-i-re-over-engineered-my-home-network/) that prompted me to look at this in the first place
